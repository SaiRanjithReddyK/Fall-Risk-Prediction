# Fall Risk Prediction in Women with Type 2 Diabetes

## Overview
This project predicts fall risk in women aged 55+ with Type 2 Diabetes, leveraging real-time data from Intermountain Health. The goal is to provide actionable insights for clinical decision-making and administrative planning.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Intermountain Health
- **Key Variables**:
  - History of falls
  - Diabetes diagnosis
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - A1C levels
  - Medications
  - Patient demographics

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - `dplyr`: Data manipulation
  - `ggplot2`: Data visualization
  - `caret`: Model training and evaluation
  - `randomForest`: Machine learning model
  - `tidyr`: Data cleaning and reshaping

## Project Structure

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the raw data for model readiness.
   - Addressed missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized key trends and correlations using `ggplot2`.
   - Identified significant predictors of fall risk.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented machine learning models such as Random Forest.
   - Optimized hyperparameters to improve model performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved model accuracy of 85%.
   - Evaluated precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Business Value
- **For Patients**: Personalized fall prevention strategies.
- **For Clinical Teams**: Data-driven support for patient care.
- **For Administrative Teams**: Improved resource allocation and safety policies.
